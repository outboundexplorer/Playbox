1.  When underlining using the standard 'text-decoration: underline' style, this will inherit from the parent node.
    This is an issue as this will cause the underline to be rendered in the wrong color.  How can we apply a color
    and make sure that the color is applied underneath.

2.  How can we undo a text-decoration: underline for just the current node

3.  When highlighting text, what is the correct behaviour.  If we finish highlighting off-page, should the selection
    still be valid or should we just cancel the selection?
